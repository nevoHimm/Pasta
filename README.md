# Pasta
Interactive Pasta-Dish maker.
Using Rhino's Grasshopper (visual coding), I've created a Euclidian Pasta Space and an interactive pasta dish maker. Each user is invited to choose their preferences which will generate a unique pasta bowl for their likings (as shown in the poster attached).

1 - choose 3 sauces.
2 - choose richness of the sauces.
3 - Decide portion size.
4 - Pastas shapes will be generated and placed on a plate with the sauces you've chosen.
